Todo:
    — Slightly adjust letter alignment.
    — Rename Game to Level.
    — Consider re-adding OFT as a word.
    — Reconsider these words: OFT, CEL, ERGO, LILT, LOIN.
    — Make the hitbox just a tad larger.
    — Make fifteen real levels.
    — Fiddle with those levels and weed out incorrect word judgments.
    — Create a tool to auto-analyze any level and determine all the possible
      words that can possibly be tried when playing it which are currently
      deemed to be words.
    — Playtest.
    — Remove the dictionary-trimming tool.
    — Finalize the name of the game and the credits screen.
    — Swap in the final levels file.
    — Play through the whole game once.
    — Compile for Linux.
    — Publish for Linux on itch.io.
    — Bonus: Compile for Windows and publish that to itch.io too.

Possible tweaks:
    — Make the undo/restart text show up from the start for
      all levels but the first (otherwise I think players will
      "learn" that it indicates failure).
    — Gravity should look a little more pleasing (as it stands,
      tiles reach their terminal velocity quite quickly).

Probably rejected:
    — Selection flashes when an incorrect word is attempted.
    — Tiles leave green ghosts when a correct word is shot.
    — Each level has a minor graphic besides its tiles (such as
      a floor).
        — And it fades in and fades out with level transitions?
    — Dark mode.
    — Endless mode?
    — Puzzle variations:
        — Large tiles (2×1, 1×2, 2×2, etc).
        — Blank tiles that do not need to be used (but can hold
          up other tiles).
    — Title screen? Probably not.
    — Reset should do nothing if tiles are falling (because it
      could be the start of the level).
    — More pleasing indicator of the restart/undo feature.
