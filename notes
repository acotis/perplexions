Todo:
    — Make fifteen real levels.
    — Fiddle with those levels and weed out incorrect word judgments.
    — Playtest.
    — Remove the dictionary-trimming tool.
    — Compile for Linux.
    — Publish for Linux on itch.io.
    — Bonus: Compile for Windows and publish that to itch.io too.

Possible tweaks:
    — Gravity should look a little more pleasing (as it stands,
      tiles reach their terminal velocity quite quickly).

Probably rejected:
    — Selection flashes when an incorrect word is attempted.
    — Tiles leave green ghosts when a correct word is shot.
    — Each level has a minor graphic besides its tiles (such as
      a floor).
        — And it fades in and fades out with level transitions?
    — Dark mode.
    — Endless mode?
    — Puzzle variations:
        — Large tiles (2×1, 1×2, 2×2, etc).
        — Blank tiles that do not need to be used (but can hold
          up other tiles).
    — Title screen? Probably not.
    — Reset should do nothing if tiles are falling (because it
      could be the start of the level).
    — More pleasing indicator of the restart/undo feature.
