Todo:
    — Look over the current code, make sure it makes sense and seems sound.
    — Minimum viable product:
        — Level transition (fade-in, fade-out).
        — Design five levels.
        — Basic indicator that the game is over.
        — Blue indicator of the restart feature.
    — Wishlist (easy):
        — Tiles darken when the mouse is over them.
        — Selection graphic is darkening tiles instead of a line.
        — Single-move undo.
            — Store a list of previous states.
            — Just use vecs, it'll be fast enough.
            — Use the same list of previous states to implement level restarts.
        — Selection flashes when an incorrect word is attempted.
        — Tiles leave green ghosts when a correct word is shot.
        — Tiles initially fall in from the sky when the level starts.
        — "Undo interface": if the mouse is over the second-to-last tile in the selection path, remove the last tile.
        — Each level has a minor graphic besides its tiles (such as a floor).
        — Dark mode.
    — Wishlist (maybe hard):
        — There is some victory animation when you finish a puzzle.
        — Large tiles (2×1, 1×2, 2×2, etc).
        — Endless mode?
    — Further ideas:
        — Title screen? Probably not.
        — Use color somewhere?

    — Design a bunch of levels.
    — Wishlist:
