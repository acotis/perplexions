Todo:
    — Minimum viable product:
        — Five real levels.
        — Better wordlist that doesn't consider all these bullshit
          words to be real.
        — Package up the font with the game somehow.
    — Wishlist (easy):
        — Ten real levels.
        — Fifteen real levels.
        — Gravity should look a little more pleasing (as it stands,
          tiles reach their terminal velocity quite quickly).
        — Reset should do nothing if tiles are falling (because it
          could be the start of the level).
        — Selection flashes when an incorrect word is attempted.
        — Tiles leave green ghosts when a correct word is shot.
        — Each level has a minor graphic besides its tiles (such as
          a floor).
            — And it fades in and fades out with level transitions?
        — Dark mode.
    — Wishlist (maybe hard):
        — More pleasing indicator of the restart/undo feature.
        — Victory animation when you finish a puzzle.
        — Minor animation when you clear some tiles.
            — Maybe a small starburst, and the victory animation is
              a large starburst?
        — Endless mode?
        — Puzzle variations:
            — Large tiles (2×1, 1×2, 2×2, etc).
            — Blank tiles that do not need to be used (but can hold
              up other tiles).
    — Further ideas:
        — Title screen? Probably not.
        — Use color somewhere?
        
    — Try following this tutorial to get it on the web: https://ianjk.com/game-engine-in-rust/
    — Design a bunch of levels.
    — Wishlist:
