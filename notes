Todo:
    — Selection graph still draws a line but it's nicer.
    — Minimum viable product:
        — Five real levels.
        — Basic indicator that the game is over.
        — Basic indicator of the restart feature.
    — Wishlist (easy):
        — Bug-fix: the mouseover highlight is determined by the tile's
          actual position, not its mere intended coordinates.
        — Moused-over tile is ALWAYS part of selection when mouse is lifted,
          even if it's not close enough to the center to select it normally.
        — Selection flashes when an incorrect word is attempted.
        — Ten levels.
        — Tiles leave green ghosts when a correct word is shot.
        — Single-move undo.
            — Store a list of previous states.
            — Just use vecs, it'll be fast enough.
            — Use the same list of previous states to implement level restarts.
        — Fifteen levels.
        — "Undo interface": if the mouse is over the second-to-last tile in the selection path, remove the last tile.
        — Each level has a minor graphic besides its tiles (such as a floor).
            — And it fades in and fades out with level transitions?
        — Dark mode.
    — Wishlist (maybe hard):
        — There is some victory animation when you finish a puzzle.
        — Endless mode?
        — Puzzle variations:
            — Large tiles (2×1, 1×2, 2×2, etc).
            — Blank tiles that do not need to be used (but can hold up other tiles).
    — Further ideas:
        — Title screen? Probably not.
        — Use color somewhere?
        
    — Try following this tutorial to get it on the web: https://ianjk.com/game-engine-in-rust/
    — Design a bunch of levels.
    — Wishlist:
