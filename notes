Todo:
    — Single-move undo.
        — Store a list of previous states.
        — Just use vecs, it'll be fast enough.
        — Use the same list of previous states to implement level
          restarts.
    — Basic indicator of the restart feature.
    — Basic indicator of the undo feature.
    — Minimum viable product:
        — Five real levels.
        — Basic indicator that the game is over.
            — Last level uses solid-color tiles that can't be
              selected.
            — "Q to quit" only appears on this screen (and probably
              is only true on this screen).
        — Better wordlist that doesn't consider all these bullshit
          words to be real.
    — Wishlist (easy):
        — Gravity should look a little more pleasing (as it stands,
          tiles reach their terminal velocity quite quickly).
        — Reset should do nothing if tiles are falling (because it
          could be the start of the level).
        — Selection flashes when an incorrect word is attempted.
        — Ten real levels.
        — Tiles leave green ghosts when a correct word is shot.
        — Fifteen real levels.
        — Each level has a minor graphic besides its tiles (such as
          a floor).
            — And it fades in and fades out with level transitions?
        — Dark mode.
    — Wishlist (maybe hard):
        — There is some victory animation when you finish a puzzle.
        — Endless mode?
        — Puzzle variations:
            — Large tiles (2×1, 1×2, 2×2, etc).
            — Blank tiles that do not need to be used (but can hold
              up other tiles).
    — Further ideas:
        — Title screen? Probably not.
        — Use color somewhere?

    — Design a bunch of levels.
