Todo:
    — Make fifteen real levels.
        — X X X X X
        — X X . . .
        — . . . . .
    — Weed out as many bogus words as I can using my tool.
    — Playtest with Chase?
        — If so, add a credits screen for her as well.
    — Compile for Linux and Windows.
        — Dev options turned off.
        — Release mode turned on!
    — Assemble the files I intend to publish.
    — Play through the whole game once by invoking the executable that I plan to publish.
        — Fiddle with edge cases a bit during this playthrough.
    — Publish game on itch.io.
        — Make it available under CC0.
        — Publish the source too and make that available under CC0 as well.

Possible tweaks:
    — Make the undo/restart text show up from the start for
      all levels but the first (otherwise I think players will
      "learn" that it indicates failure).
    — Gravity should look a little more pleasing (as it stands,
      tiles reach their terminal velocity quite quickly).

Probably rejected:
    — Selection flashes when an incorrect word is attempted.
    — Tiles leave green ghosts when a correct word is shot.
    — Each level has a minor graphic besides its tiles (such as
      a floor).
        — And it fades in and fades out with level transitions?
    — Dark mode.
    — Endless mode?
    — Puzzle variations:
        — Large tiles (2×1, 1×2, 2×2, etc).
        — Blank tiles that do not need to be used (but can hold
          up other tiles).
    — Title screen? Probably not.
    — Reset should do nothing if tiles are falling (because it
      could be the start of the level).
    — More pleasing indicator of the restart/undo feature.
